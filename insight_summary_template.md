# 1-Page Insight Summary (Template)

Project: Procurement Performance Analysis (SAP MM Simulation Data)  
Goal: Evaluate delivery reliability and cost performance to support better vendor and plant decisions.

## Key Metrics (fill after you run the analysis)
- Total Purchase Orders: [ ]
- On-Time Delivery %: [ ]
- Average Delay (days): [ ]
- Total Spend: [ ]
- Total Cost Variance: [ ]

## Findings
1. Delivery performance: On-time delivery is [ ]%. Late deliveries are concentrated in [vendors/plants].
2. Vendor reliability: Vendors with the highest average delays are [ ].
3. Cost variance: Highest cost variance observed for [ ], indicating potential pricing or process issues.
4. Plant comparison: [Plant] shows higher delays, suggesting operational/logistics bottlenecks.

## Recommendations
- Introduce a vendor scorecard (On-Time %, Avg Delay, Cost Variance).
- Set alerts for POs predicted to be late based on delay patterns.
- Review contract terms for high-variance vendors; standardize delivery expectations.
- Align planning timelines across plants to reduce process-driven delays.

## What This Demonstrates
- Structured data preparation & QA
- SQL querying for performance KPIs
- Python-based enrichment/cleaning
- Power BI dashboard design and stakeholder-ready insights
